# Overview

The purpose of this repo is to gather all the assets, rules and design processes in one place.

Our goals of having the [project planning](https://github.com/JoyStream/joystream), [public communication](https://github.com/Joystream/communications) and (this) design repo on github, is to cultivate an open and transparant structure, throughout the organization and community.

# Contribute

Joystream is an open source project, where everyone is welcome to contribute. We hope our culture of openness and transparancy will make it easier for contributors to get onboarded.

# Structure

This files in this repo are divided into four folders, each containing all relevant assets, usage rules, documentation, and in some cases, the design basis.

## Joystream Branding

All the general Joystream branding assets are kept here. This includes logos, fonts, colorways, social media profiles/covers, and the rules for how the assets chould be used.

## Joystream.org Assets

All designs, illustrations, animations, etc. used on the joystream.org, and its subpages*, can be found in here.

*Exceptions are assets from our blog, held in this [repo](https://github.com/Joystream/communications), and assets our hosted testnet application, held [here](https://github.com/Joystream/design/application-assets/pioneer).

## Application Assets

All designs, illustrations, animations, etc. used in the current and future Joystream Apps, will be found in here.

## Other Assets

This directory is meant to contain assets that does not fall directly under the Joystream platform, but is still related for the time being. Examples are branding for [Jsgenesis](https://www.jsgenesis.com) and the [Staked Podcast](https://staked.libsyn.com/)

Joystream branding and assets should in general find a place in one of the other folders.
