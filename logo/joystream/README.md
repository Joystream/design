# Logo

_Before we agreed on a final logo concept we went through multiple iterations of various concepts. We explored various ideas in depth before settling on the final logo design._

Our logomark is a combination of the letter J (to represent the name Joystream) and three parallel stripes that are a representation of streaming data and the flow of information and technology.

This folder contains a number of logo variants, for use in various places as defined by the brand guide.
