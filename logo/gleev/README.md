## 3D files

Gleev icon is available as an editable and procedurally generated 3D model inside of a Blender project file. In the file, by changing the environmental and logo materials and enabling/disabling different light setups (it's all labeled), a Gleev icon can be rendered in light, dark and cinematic versions that all vector icons are based on.
